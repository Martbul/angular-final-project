This is my final project for Soft Uni Angular Feb 2024
This webapp features front end and back end.
The front end is written in Angular and the back and is in nodeJS.

In final-project-angular open the terminal and start the project with "ng serve"
Then to start the server use "npm start"
The app uses MongoDB!
